# NASA Asteroid Risk Assessment Dashboard - Streamlined 2-Week Plan

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a focused, polished asteroid dashboard that showcases technical skills without overcomplicating.

**Core Concept**: Clean, modern dashboard showing current asteroid threats with essential visualizations
- **Frontend**: React with 2-3 key visualizations
- **Backend**: Simple Express API with NASA NeoWs integration
- **Focus**: Quality over quantity - nail the fundamentals

## Week 1: MVP Foundation

### Days 1-2: Setup & Backend Core

#### Day 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize project structure
```
asteroid-dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/    # Create React App
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/     # Express server
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```
- [x] Get NASA API key
- [x] Set up basic Express server with CORS
- [ ] Test NASA NeoWs API connection
- [x] Create .env files and basic configs

#### Day 2: Backend API
- [ ] Build 3 core endpoints:
```javascript
GET /api/asteroids/current     // Next 7 days
GET /api/asteroids/stats       // Basic statistics
GET /api/asteroids/:id         // Asteroid details
```
- [ ] Implement basic risk scoring algorithm
- [ ] Add simple caching (15min TTL)
- [ ] Error handling for NASA API failures
- [ ] Test with Postman

### Days 3-4: Frontend Foundation

#### Day 3: React Setup & Components
- [ ] Install dependencies: `axios`, `chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2`, `tailwindcss`
- [ ] Create basic layout with header/main sections
- [ ] Build reusable components:
  - `AsteroidCard` - shows individual asteroid info
  - `LoadingSpinner` - for async states
  - `ErrorMessage` - for error handling
- [ ] Set up API service layer
- [ ] Basic responsive grid layout

#### Day 4: Core Dashboard View
- [ ] **Main Dashboard Page**:
  - Overview cards (total asteroids, highest risk, next approach)
  - Simple asteroid list with sorting
  - Basic search/filter by name
- [ ] **Asteroid Detail Modal**:
  - Click asteroid card to see details
  - Show all key metrics in clean format
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling

### Days 5-7: Essential Visualizations

#### Day 5: Timeline Chart
- [ ] **Approach Timeline**:
  - Simple horizontal timeline showing next 30 days
  - Color-coded dots by risk level
  - Hover tooltips with basic info
  - Click to open detail modal
- [ ] Make it responsive and interactive

#### Day 6: Risk Overview Charts
- [ ] **Risk Distribution Pie Chart**:
  - Show % of asteroids by risk level (Low/Medium/High)
- [ ] **Size vs Distance Scatter Plot**:
  - X-axis: miss distance, Y-axis: estimated diameter
  - Color by risk level
  - Simple, clean design
- [ ] Both charts clickable to filter main list

#### Day 7: Polish & Mobile
- [ ] Make all components mobile-responsive
- [ ] Add dark theme (mission control feel)
- [ ] Improve typography and spacing
- [ ] Add smooth transitions
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes

  - Visual sort indicators
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**:
  - Simple auto-refresh every 30 minutes
  - "Last updated" timestamp
  - Manual refresh button

#### Day 9: Data Enhancement
- [ ] **Risk Calculator Component**:
  - Simple sliders for asteroid parameters
  - Real-time risk score calculation
  - Educational - show how size/distance affects risk
- [ ] **Comparison Feature**:
  - Select 2-3 asteroids to compare side-by-side
  - Simple table format
- [ ] **Statistics Dashboard**:
  - Average approach distance
  - Largest asteroid this month
  - Most dangerous upcoming approach

### Days 10-11: Testing & Optimization

#### Day 10: Testing & Bug Fixes
- [ ] Write basic React tests for key components
- [ ] Test API error scenarios
